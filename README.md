  ## How it's made:
  <strong>Tech used:</strong> ReactJs, TailwindCSS, Firebase & Firestore
  
  > I made this project to strengthen my CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) knowledge. 

  - For frontend structure I used ReactJs and implemented design principles I learned. 
  - Firebase/Firestore is used for the database and user authentication 
  - I used one of my favorite CSS Frameworks TailwindCSS for creating the user interface. 
  
  ## Lessons Learned:
  
  Creating, updating or reading can be done in server-side but deleting should be done in client-side. So I had to find the right way to implement this to my project. Hopefully, I've come accross with a good article about this situation. For dynamically render different pages according to coin's name I had to use one of react's native hooks 'useParams' and combine it with routing. It was tricky but made me realize how powerfull react is.
    
  Overall, this was a tremendous learning experience.
